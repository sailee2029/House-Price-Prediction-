Problem statement:
Build House Price Prediction in Bangalore City using Linear Regression. 

Abstract:
Linear Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning Model for finding the 
relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. Linear 
regression performs the task to predict the response (dependent) variable value 
(y) based on a given (independent) explanatory variable (x). So, this regression 
technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y (output).
Using scikit-learn module build a Linear Regression module using Python, after 
training the model we can predict the house price.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Load DataSet
Step 2: import required libraries
Step 3: Export features from labelled data.
Step 4: Finalize target()
Step 5: split data into training and testing set.
Step 6: Call linear regression model from sklearn.linear.model
Step 7: fit training scoreStep 8: Evaluate Training Score
Step 9: Apply validation data(Testing) on model and get predictions. 
Step 10: Calculate Testing Score
Step 11: Construct Data Frame of actual data and Predicted data

Conclusion:
I have created a Linear Regression Model using SciKit-Learn
Module which helps us predict House Price.
